The Internet with a capital 'I' does not provide a way for the DnD community to create and maintain a chracter for use in one's weekly DnD excursions.  As is, one must utilize a pen and paper to keep track of this information.  It is inefficient to maintain character information in this manner, as each round of play can result in information changing regarding an individual character.
